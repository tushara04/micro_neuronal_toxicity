# Modeling Neurotoxicity of Microplastics

Over the past couple years, many studies have found microplastics passing through the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). This is a big deal because the BBB is an extremely selective part of the neuroimmune system that prevents unwanted substances in the blood from entering the brain [1]. If these substances pass through, they get into the central nervous system (CNS), putting them into a direct contact with neurons, microglia, and astrocytes [2]. This contact may cause several disruptions, as described by the studies done on various species of nematodes, bivalves, crustaceans, fish and rodents. The disruptions include neuroinflammation caused by microglia (immune cells), disturbance in synaptic signaling, triggering of oxidative stress,  morphological changes, seizures, and increased risks of neurodegenerative diseases or mortality [3]. Microplastics are also known to cause cell obstruction, leading to reduced blood flow and neuronal abnormalities in mice [4]. Additionally, they can damage myelin sheaths within brain tissue, impairing the transmission of electrical signals and compromising the structural integrity of neurons [5].
