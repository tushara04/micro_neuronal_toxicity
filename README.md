# Modeling Neurotoxicity of Microplastics

    Over the past couple years, many studies have found microplastics passing through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This is a big deal because the BBB is an extremely selective part of the neuroimmune system that prevents unwanted substances in the blood from entering the brain. If these substances pass through, they get into the central nervous system (CNS), putting them into a direct contact with neurons, microglia, and astrocytes. This contact may cause several disruptions, as described by the studies done on various species of nematodes, bivalves, crustaceans, fish and rodents. The disruptions include neuroinflammation caused by microglia (immune cells), disturbance in synaptic signaling, triggering of oxidative stress,  morphological changes, seizures and increased risks of neurodegenerative diseases, etc.



# ideas: 
1. Model the effects on microplastics on neurons.
2. What is the size of a neuron? What is the size of a microplastic? Can the presence of microplastics affect how neurons interact with each other and how they perform their own actions?
4. Microplastics tend to obstruct blood brain barrier, what's the size of the blood brain barrier, and how does that the compare with that of the neuron?
